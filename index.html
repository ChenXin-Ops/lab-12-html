<h1>Don't worry about it!</h1>
<body>
    Dave found joy in the daily routine of life.
     He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute.
      He worked at a job that never seemed to change and
       he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. 
    It was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.
    He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate.
     He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time.
      It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. 
    Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.

<p>It was a weird concept. Why would I really need to generate a random paragraph? 
    Could I actually learn something from doing so? 
    All these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button. 
    To her surprise,
    she found what she least expected to see. <em>A kiss may not be the truth, but it is what we wish were true.</em>
    <strong> Winning is nice if you don't lose your integrity in the process.

<h2>LMFAO 1!</h2>
    <p>"Men, we led those dumb bugs out to the middle of nowhere to keep 'em from gettin' their filthy claws on Earth. But, we stumbled onto somethin' they're so hot for, that they're scramblin' over each other to get it. Well, I don't care if it's God's own anti-son-of-a-bitch machine, or a giant hula hoop, we're not gonna let 'em have it! What we will let 'em have is a belly full of lead, and a pool of their own blood to drown in!"

<h2>LMFAO 2!</h2>
    <p>
    "Men, here is where we show those split-chin, squid-head, sons of bitches that they could not have picked a worse enemy than the human race. We are going to blow the hell out of those dumb bugs until we don't have anything left to shoot 'em with! And then, we are going to strangle them with their own living guts!

<h1>NOOOOOOOOOO!</h1>
<P>Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. What can explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders. The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today.</P>
